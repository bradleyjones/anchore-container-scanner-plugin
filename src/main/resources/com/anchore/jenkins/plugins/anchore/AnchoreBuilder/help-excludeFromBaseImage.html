  If selected or set to 'true', any match in the Policy or Vulnerability results where Inherited From Base == true will be excluded from the final results tables. This will NOT affect the final policy evaluation status, but will remove inherited vulnerabilities from the final results.

  This is useful for filtering out inherited vulnerabilities from the final results, as they are not actionable for the image being scanned. However, it is important to note that inherited vulnerabilities are still important to understand the full risk profile of the image. 

  Default value: 'false'
